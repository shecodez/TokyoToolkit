        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          I designed TokyoToolkit.com to be a place for DIY interior / exterior design tutorials, workshops,
          documentaries, interviews, reviews, podcasts, and exploration. A space for community, global communications,
          and all things Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
          For quite a while now my dream has been to buy an old traditional style house in Japan, preferably a
          fixer-upper, so I can restore it back to its former glory while simultaneously cramming in as many modern
          conveniences in it as I can. Finally I feel (and I hope the ‘Rona also feels) it’s time to stop dreaming and
          in the immortal words of Shia LeBeouf “<a href="https://youtu.be/ZXsQAXx_ao0" target="_blank">Just Do It</a>” (https://youtu.be/ZXsQAXx_ao0).
        </p>
        <p>
          So here’s to our little community! *Somebody pop the champagne* I hope by sharing my thoughts, and journey
          here, and highlighting others' thoughts and journeys, I can help YOU realize your dream of renovating a house,
          if not in japan, feels just like Japan full of wabi-sabi, and zen interior / exterior design aesthetics.
